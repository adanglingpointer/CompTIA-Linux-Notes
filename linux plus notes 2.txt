Linux networking overview
-------------------------

there are a certain number of items that need to be configured in order for Linux to have functional networking
 - a host address
	usually this is an IPv4 or IPv6
 - network subnet mask
	to define the network
 - default gateway router address
	so traffic can leave the local network
 - hostname
	to identify your host
 - name resolution
	so you can refer to other hosts by name instead of needing to remember IP addresses
	this could be local name resolution, or through a remote server such as DNS

the network configuration can be set dynamically via the dynamic host configuration protocol
 or by using IPv6
DHCP or set live configuration manually

There are two sets of tools for configuring a live network configuration manually:
 - net-tools (legacy)
	these tools include arp, hostname, ifconfig, route, and netstat
	most distros still allow you to install them
	they are still prevelant, however they have been obsoleted by iproute2
 - iproute2

manual saved config
 - Red Hat 8 and older:
	/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
 - Debian
	/etc/network/interfaces
 - SUSE
	/etc/sysconfig/network

Network Manager
 - network service
 - a unified system for configuration of network interfaces
 - started in 2004 by Red Hat
 - CLI and graphical interface

==========

prepare for linux networking
----------------------------

in virtualbox, we can create a second adapter, as internal network
creating the same network name for two VMs will provide us with an internal network accessible only between them

==========

configure live network connections
----------------------------------

 - host address
 - network subnet
 - default gateway

these two are saved into files:
 - hostname
 - name resolution

net-tools & iproute2

Legacy Network Interface Naming

Type		Name
----		----
Ethernet	eth0, eth1
Wireless	wlan0, wlan1

the number was the order in which the machine scanned them
although simple, it meant the network device name could change depending on the order your machine saw the hardware
now the naming is more complex looking but more reliable

Consistent Network Interface Naming

Type and Location			Name
-----------------			----
Ethernetl device, PCI bus 0, slot 3	enp0s3
Wireless device, PCI bus 3, slot 0	wlp3s0

-

Legacy net-tools	iproute2 equivalent
----------------	-------------------
arp			ip neighbor
ifconfig		ip address
iptunnel		ip tunnel
mii-tool		ethtool
netstat			ss

ifconfig
	get network interface names with net-tools
ip -s addr
	the iproute2 command to list your network interfaces

route
	get the default gateway with net-tools
ip route
	get the default gateway with iproute2

sudo mii-tool enp0s8
	interfaces at hardware level via net-tools
sudo ethtool enp0s8
	interfaces at hw level via iproute2
	speed, duplex, and if cable (link detected) is plugged in

the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used for associating a hardware address like the Max address
 with a host address like an IP address

arp
	net-tools command for showing which IP address is associated with which hardware address
	 and the network interface name
ip neighbor [shortened to ip neigh, or ip n]
	iproute2 for showing hw address
	more reliable than arp
