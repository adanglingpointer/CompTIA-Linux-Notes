15. Automation and Scripting
============================

What makes a shell script a shell script?
-----------------------------------------

vi ~/script.sh
	The file extension tells VI to do syntax highlighting

 - We need to make the first line point to the shell interpreter.
 - We can do this by pointing it directly at the interpreter using an absolute path.

#!/bin/bash
 - In this case we're specifying an sbolute path to the bash interpreter executable
 - We can also use a second form:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
 - In this case, we use the ENV command to search the system path for the bash interpreter and execute it there
