Chapter 11. File Security
=========================

What is a file?
---------------

 - In Linux, everything is a file

Regular file
 - Binary or text, saved on a storage device, and can be read and written to.
 - Metadata
	- Ownership
	- Access control
	- File size
	- Creation date
	- Metadata is data that describes other data, the contents of the file

Directory file
 - Lists files
 - Associates data with files names
 - The directory associates data blocks with file names

Device drivers - drivers that connect applications to physical hardware
 - In Linux, everything is a file including printers.
 - The printer device is a file.
 - You can save data to it using the same tools that we use to save data to a regular file.
 - When that data is saved to a printer file, it's sent to the printer.
 - A printer is a kind of Character Device File

Block Device File
 - A physical device that appears as a file
 - A storage device such as a solid state disk

Character Device File
 - Unique because they can be virtual, in that they might not represent a real physical device.
 - We have a character device file called Zero that when read gives us an endless supply of zeros.
	/dev/zero = 0000000000000...
	/dev/null = text that we don't want to keep
		swallows everything that is written to it
		this is useful when you don't want the output of a command to show on the screen
 - Our screen is a character device file as well.

Network Socket File
 - Network sockets are also files.
 - Writing data to a network socket can send it across the network.
 - They may also be used to send data between programs on a local computer.

Virtual Files
 - Files that don't really exist anywhere and have no size, but you can still read and write to them
	/proc/cpuinfo
		Shows info about the CPU, has data in it, but has a size of zero bytes because the OS creates
		 the data instantly when it's being read

 - Even the output of an application is considered a file that has not been saved yet

Pipe File
 - A physical tube, or pipe, from one application to another.

What is the advantage of all of this, considering other operating systems don't operate this way?
 - The idea of everything being a file allows us to view important system information and write data to physical devices with simple tools.
 - It allows us to read block devices and the output of commands using simple text viewers.
 - It allows us to have one command communication with another without any special software, which allows us to combine multiple simple commands to solve complex problem.
 - The concept of everything being a file sets Linux apart from other operating systems and proves to be very powerful.
