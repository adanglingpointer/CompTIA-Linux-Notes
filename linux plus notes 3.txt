Linux storage system overview
-----------------------------

Types of Storage
 - File storage
 - Block storage
 - Object storage

File Storage
 - Hierarchy of files in folders
 - Data in files
 - Metadata contains path to file
 - Local file systems
 - Network file systems - NFS (Network File System), CIF (Windows Common Internet Filesystem)

Block Storage
 - Exposes blocks of binary data
 - Blocks have unique identifiers
 - Storage system reassembles blocks
 - Storage area networks (iSCSI)

Object Storage
 - Manages data
 - Links data to associated metadata
 - Data is stored in discrete objects
 - Single repository
 - Red Hat Ceph

ATA Drives
 - local drives in a legacy system
 - Parallel ATA drive with a flexible ribbon cable with 80 wires
 - Two drives per cable
	To have more than two drives, a system needs multiple controllers
 - Speed: 133 MB/sec
 - /dev/hda, hdb

SCSI Drives
 - Small Computer System Interface
 - higher end legacy systems
 - Parallel SCSI drive with larger flat ribbon cable with 168 wires, used mostly for servers
 - 16 drives per cable
 - Speed: 320 MB/sec
 - /dev/sda, sdb

SATA Drives
 - newer systems
 - Serial ATA with narrow serial cable
 - One drive per cable
	Can be a spinning disk, or a Solid State Drive
 - we measure serial interfaces with Bits per second instead of Bytes
 - Speed: 6 Gbps
 - /dev/sda, sdb

SAS Drives
 - Serial Attached SCSI
 - Parallel SCSI was replaced by Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
 - Backward compatible with SATA
 - Speed: 12 Gbps
 - /dev/sda, sdb

NVMe Drives
 - Non-Volatile Memory Express
 - no cable at all, plugs into slot like a memory stick
 - The structure of the internal components is very similar to a solid state SATA drive,
	the only difference being the interfaces direct via a PCI Express bus
 - Speed: 32 Gbps
 - /dev/nvme0n1p1
	nvme followed by device number, namespace number, and partition number

USB Drives
 - Thumb drive
 - SSD in USB case
 - Speed: 5-20 Gbps
 - /dev/sda, sdb
